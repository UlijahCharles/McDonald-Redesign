# McDonald-Redesign
A redesign for Mcdonald's website.

🍟 McDonald's Website Redesign (React)
🌟 Project Overview
This project is a complete front-end redesign and rebuild of the official McDonald's website. My goal was to create a modern, user-friendly, and visually engaging experience that enhances the digital ordering and browsing process, utilizing the  capabilities of React.

The design phase focused on improving product visibility, simplifying the navigation structure, and injecting a more contemporary and appetite appealing aesthetic while maintaining the iconic McDonald's brand identity.
